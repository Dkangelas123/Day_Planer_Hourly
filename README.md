# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code
This is a Scheduler from 9 am to 5 pm that will allow you to manage your time with more efficiency, and it would change color according to the hour.
Red would be when the hour of the schedule is the current time, green is for future hours, and grey for past hours.
The text would be remaining there even if you reload the page.
